This is a project I made for fun, just to practice how to create and combine components in React. It's actually a re-factor of my [very first landing page with CSS](https://elmolinillo.github.io/landing-page/). Time flies... :')





This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Design from [The Odin Project](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png).
